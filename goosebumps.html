Yeah
7:30 in the night, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

713
Through the 281, yeah, I'm riding, why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flying, sipping low-key
I'm sipping low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
When I'm pulling up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah

We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't - with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad, I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucing in the city, don't get misinformed
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you (brr, brr, brr)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the - up off me (brr, brr, brr)

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time

I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my-
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual
(I can) buy the building, burn the building
Take your -, rebuild the building just to - some more
(I can) justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war

Put the - on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the - on a high horse
That - to die for
That - to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah

I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time</pre>
